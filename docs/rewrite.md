# Rewriting The Midnight
As many of you know, Cryptic Mushroom's The Midnight Development Team is planning on completely rewriting the entirety of The Midnight for Minecraft 1.16.1. On this page, you will find various pieces of information such as what we have publically confirmed for the rewrite, the development roadmap, and more.

## Current Development Status
- Currently waiting for Minecraft Forge to update to Minecraft 1.16.1.

## What's planned for the rewrite?
The following is information we have publicly confirmed will be a part of the rewrite.

- The Midnight for Minecraft 1.16.1 *will not* be backwards compatible with The Midnight for Minecraft 1.15.2 or Minecraft 1.14.4. In addition, there are no plans to backport the rewrite to any Minecraft version below 1.16. **Essentially, we will be dropping all support for previous versions of The Midnight.**
- Entrance rifts will be reworked. This includes dark pearls.
- Rifters will be completely redone and will be implemented last. If we choose to, we may remove the limby animation the rifters currently possess.
- Many balance issues The Midnight currently holds will be addressed. We plan on making The Midnight much more demanding, unforgiving, and rewarding.
- There will be an entirely new skybox (not as bright) accompanied by a new shader system that the mod will use heavily for game progression. Our new shader system is still experimental but has been tested successfully in a branch called `feature/1.15.2-postfx-shaders` and we will continue to use it as much as we can towards our advantage.
